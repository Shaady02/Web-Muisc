      But I don't really wanna have this fight
      I just wanna feel like I belong
      And every time my heart swings back to you
      You are my morning and my truth
      And all that I can do is sing this song
      It ain't that long, hm
      
      And nothing says "I love you" like your eyes
      Fill my lips with carbon dioxide
      I just wanna feel like I deserve you
      'Cause you deserve me
      Baby, it's the way that you can see
      What I miss and what I can never be
      I just wanna feel like I deserve you
      'Cause you deserve me
      
      Maybe you were wrong and I was right
      I don't care, won't you stay another night?
      I just need some time to be myself
      I couldn't say "I need you" on that night
      When you left and I lost all track of time
      I just want you close so I can feel you
      Can you feel me? Mm
      
      And nothing says "I love you" like the words
      That were never said, but could be heard
      If only there was peace around us, baby
      You would hear me
      And maybe it's the way that lovers do
      I just want for me what I want for you
      Only with the sun above us maybe
      You would see me
      
      Mm, mm, mm
      
      And even if you leave, I may be fine
      'Cause my heart, it has its own design
      And even if you never see it, baby
      You're all that I need
      
      Maybe it's the silence in your eyes
      Maybe it's the lilac when you're shy
      Maybe it's the mystery of your love
      All I need is a sign from the stars above
      Maybe it's the way that you breathe in me
      Maybe it's the man that you see in me
      Maybe it's the fragrance of your hair
      Yeah, I just wanna kiss you when you're there
      
      I just want you all around me, baby
      Can we make that happen, please?` },
